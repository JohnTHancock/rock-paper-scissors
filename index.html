    //Each game will consist of 5 rounds. Each round will begin with the computer selecting via random number generation.
    //The rounds will exist in a for loop inside a larger function called game. The for loop will be a simple increment counter.
    //The player is prompted for an input. The input string is converted to lower case and then compared against the computer
    //selection. 
    //Once the result of the round is determined, an increment will be added to one of two variables that store the score
    //of the player and computer, respectively. Once 5 rounds have passed, the scores will be compared and the winner is 
    //announced.
